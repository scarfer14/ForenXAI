**TITLE**: IDS 2018 Intrusion CSVs (CSE-CIC-IDS2018)
About Dataset
Background Information
This dataset was originally created by the University of New Brunswick for analyzing ***DDoS data***. You can find the full dataset here. This dataset was sourced fully from 2018, and will not be updated in the future, however, new versions of the dataset will be available at the link above. The dataset itself was based on logs of the university's servers, which found various DoS attacks throughout the publicly available period. When writing machine learning notebooks for this data, note that the Label column is arguably the most important portion of data, as it determines if the packets sent are malicious or not. Reference the below Column Structures heading for more information about this and more columns.
