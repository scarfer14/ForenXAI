    "- [ ] Load the NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset (or skip if confirmed pre-cleaned) and log basic stats via `df.shape`/`df.info()`.\n",
    "- [ ] Sanity-check for nulls, duplicates, and obvious inconsistencies; visualize any anomalies (e.g., `df.isna().sum().plot(kind=\"bar\")`).\n",
    "- [ ] Produce a quick EDA snapshot (pairplot/histograms) so downstream teams know the distribution shifts.\n",
    "- [ ] Split data using Stratified Sampling to ensure the train/validation/test sets maintain the same percentage of rare attack classes as the original data\n",
    "- [ ] Keep/train/val/test split artifacts (70/15/15) deterministic—Tip: reuse a shared `RANDOM_STATE` when calling `train_test_split`. (example: RANDOM_STATE = 42 guarantees deterministic pseudo-random numbers, so every train_test_split, StratifiedKFold, etc., yields the exact same rows each run. Set it before splitting and pass it into every splitter/model that accepts random_state; otherwise splits change between runs and comparisons become inconsistent.\n",
